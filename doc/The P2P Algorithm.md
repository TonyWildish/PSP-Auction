# The algorithm in a nutshell:
Let **_Q_** be the network bandwidth that is 

There are two design aspects: the message process that allows an allocation to be defined, and a Nash implementation, which follows allocation rules designed to drive the players to a satisfactory equilibrium.

## The message process:
To make this scalable for use on the WAN, we make a couple of design decisions:
- messages must be as small as possible, yet still be complete enough that the auction can proceed based on the messages alone (no a-priori knowledge of external factors etc)
- computation at the auction-centre must be minimised, to allow a rapid response, where 'rapid' has yet to be defined.

Let **_Q_** represent the resource to be shared, i.e. the network bandwidth.

Let **_I_** be the set of players, \{1,...,*I*\}, participating in the auction.
